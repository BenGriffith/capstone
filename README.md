## Domain Background
Every year, approximately 7.6 million companion animals end up in US shelters. Many animals are given up as unwanted by their owners, while others are picked up after getting lost or taken out of cruelty situations. Many of these animals find forever families to take them home, but just as many are not so lucky. 2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized in the US every year.

My personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in this domain is due to the enjoyment animals bring to my life and the lives of others. I am a former and current animal owner and the reality of so many abandoned companion animals is heartbreaking.
